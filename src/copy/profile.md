I have never worked a day in my life, I am fortunate enough to get paid for doing my hobby. I love people, code, learning and I love to build awesome stuff with others that add real value to those using it. I see myself as an entrepreneurial developer who loves to innovate and create new things and see them through from inception to realisation.

I am a husband and father who values family time. I believe that a healthy home allows for a healthy employee. In my spare time I try to keep up with the latest progressions in my field by doing online courses through Udemy & Udacity. I sometimes attend meetups if life allows for it, and read as much Medium, Hackernoon & Harvard Business Review articles as possible.

From a tech perspective I am digging into web3 and blockchain, having completed an amazing course on Udemy recently - "Ethereum and Solidity the complete developers guide" by Stephen Grider. My next course will be one on Machine Learning - can't wait!

From a professional and personal perspective I am learning more and more about the "leanstack" - how to continuously innovate.
