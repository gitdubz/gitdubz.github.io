### Engineering Team Lead at Responsive Studio

##### _February 2014 - present_

**TLDR;** I'm a Full-stack engineer, Team lead, Scrum master and Product owner working in a cross-functional, semi-remote team. Utilising an Agile approach to developing software, testing it using unit & end-to-end testing in order to respond to ever changing requirements & loving it!

#### Flamelink  
I have always had the urge to create a realtime headless CMS, but could never really find a scalable solution for it until Google released Firebase. I founded and served as the initial Tech-lead & Product Owner in my spare time (currently Project Manager, Scrum Master, Product Owner and Senior Developer in a full time capacity). The idea caught the attention of my current employers who now actively fund the development of Flamelink - a firebase CMS. The project has been going for 4 years, but has only been in production for 2. We currently have 7500+ users, growing steadily on a month-to-month bases. Our users span 80% of countries world wide, ranging from freelance developers to agencies.

Firebase, Cloud Firestore, React, Redux, React-intl, Jest, Glamorous, Emotion, Styled Components, Node, Webpack, Cypress, Stripe, Google App Engine, Google Keychain Manager

#### myChep  
Senior Front-end Engineer and Feature lead. Surely one of the most complex apps currently in production when it comes to infrastructure, code, and integration. myChep has thousands of business rules stretching over 65 countries catering for hundreds of transactions at a time from any given user in nearly real time.

myChep currently supports 21 languages in 65 countries, with 16.5 M + operations per year, and more than 50K end users

#### Old Mutual - More Than Yourself
Worked as a Full-stack PHP engineer orchestrating a secure fundraising/donation platform using Wordpress and a custom PHP API. The platform catered for all devices in a fully responsive manor. I loved this project due to the difference the rewrite made. Donations that totalled to R100K over 3 years, but then rocketed to over a R1 Million in the next 12 months after the release of the new platform.

**_Technologies used_**  
PHP, Wordpress, Payfast, HTML5, CSS3, SASS, Bootstrap

### Founder & CTO at VigoCMS

##### May 2010 - September 2012

VigoCMS was birthed out of an internal product created at NuSoft. We quickly realised the need for low cost, great looking, no development needed websites - to get small businesses off the ground in an affordable manor. During my time at VigoCMS I was responsible for architecting the platform in such a way that we could allow our customers to easily choose and customise their online presence. Not only that but also to allow for plugins and integration with external services.

**Achievements**  
2014: VigoCMS went on to win the MTN app of the year award  
2015: VigoCMS partnered with Webnic, one of the top 50 Asian domain registrars to become the default site builder for all of their clients.

**_Technologies used_**  
PHP, MySQL, CSS, HTML5, jQuery, Ajax, Asure

### Founder & CTO at Nusoft

##### January 2008 - September 2012

One of my greatest learning experiences was to start NuSoft. The company specialised in establishing brands and driving online business. We targeted niche startups helping them on their journey to express themselves through their corporate identity, online presence, and custom online platforms. As CTO I was responsible for the direction and strategy when it came to our tech-stack, resources and ops ensuring we were utilising the technologies and services in a profitable, sustainable and secure manner.

With NuSoft being a lean startup without capital injection, part of my duties was to lead a team of developers. Two of the most interesting projects we did were:

#### RSP (Realtime Security Platform)
The platform had to cater for employee management, roles and permissions, time tracking, document storage, in-app documentation viewing, realtime notifications, realtime chats, realtime political climate alerts, event calendars and emailing to name just a few - all within an encrypted environment.

The purpose for the platform was to enable security teams to safely host and escort high-profile United Nations officials in any country, sharing realtime information about the immediate environment.

**_Technologies used_**    
PHP, MySQL, CSS, HTML5, jQuery, Ajax, HTTPS

#### NuSoft CMS (now VigoCMS)
With every client having their own needs, we knew we had to develop a base platform that we could extend for all new clients in order to serve then in a timely fashion. So we built NuSoft CMS. The CMS was easy to configure, deploy and customise, allowing us to focus our efforts on what our clients needed as opposed to what we needed to do, before we could meet their needs. The internal product later became the company now known as VigoCMS.
